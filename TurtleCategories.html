            <p id="TC-main-p1">Sea turtles, sometimes known as marine turtles, are reptiles belonging to the order Testudines and the suborder Cryptodira. The flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley sea turtles are the seven existing sea turtle species. Sri Lanka's waters are home to five different kinds of sea turtles namely, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead and olive ridley.</p>

                            <h4>Green Sea Turtle</h4>
                            <p class="T-p1">The largest hard-shelled sea turtle is the green sea turtle. They are the only sea turtles that are herbivores, eating primarily seagrasses and algae. This diet is what gives their fat a greenish color (not their shells), hence their name.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="T-p2">The hue of the carapace ranges from pale to very dark green and from plain to vivid yellow, brown, and green tones with radiating stripes. In Atlantic populations, the plastron ranges from white, dirty white, or yellowish to dark grey-bluish-green in Pacific populations. Hatchlings are dark brown or nearly black in color, with a white underside and white flipper margins.</p>

                            <h4>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</h4>
                            <p class="T-p1">Hawksbill sea turtles live in all of the world's major seas' tropical and subtropical waters. Hawksbills derive their name from its distinctive beak-like mouth, which resembles that of a hawk and is ideal for locating food supplies in difficult-to-reach cracks and crevices. They are the only species of sea turtle that can survive primarily on sponges. Hawksbill turtles are essential to the functioning of marine ecosystems.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="T-p2">Hawksbill turtles have mottled shells that are a random mix of amber, orange, red, yellow, black, and brown colors. The shells contain serrated edges and overlapping scutes. Their heads taper to a point, and their lower jaw is V-shaped, giving them the appearance of a hawk.</p>

                            <h4>Leatherback Sea Turtle</h4>
                            <p class="T-p1">The leatherback sea turtle is the world's largest turtle. They are the only marine turtle species that lacks scales and a hard shell. They are named after their strong rubbery skin and have been there since the time of the dinosaurs. Leatherback turtles are highly migratory, swimming about 10,000 kilometers between nesting and foraging locations each year. They are also skilled divers.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="T-p2">The leatherback sea turtle is the only one without a hard shell. It has a broad, elongated, and flexible carapace with seven distinct ridges running the length of the animal. Except in hatchlings, the carapace is made up of a layer of thin, strong, rubbery skin that is reinforced by hundreds of small bone plates. All of the flippers lack claws. The carapace is dark grey or black with white or light patches, while the plastron is whitish to black with five ridges. White spots cover the carapace of hatchlings.</p>

                            <h4>Loggerhead Sea Turtle</h4>
                            <p class="T-p1">The loggerhead turtle gets its name from its enormous head, which houses powerful jaw muscles that allow it to chew on hard-shelled food like whelks and conch.  </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="T-p2">The heads of loggerhead turtles are big, with powerful jaws. In adults and subadults, the top shell (carapace) is slightly heart-shaped and reddish-brown, while the bottom shell (plastron) is often a pale yellowish color.</p>

                            <h4>Olive Ridley Sea Turtle</h4>
                            <p class="T-p1">The olive ridley takes its name from the color of its heart-shaped shell, which is olive green. The species is one of the world's tiniest sea turtles, and it lives predominantly in the tropical parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic seas.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="T-p2">Olive ridley turtles have an olive/grayish-green carapace (upper shell) with 5 to 9 pairs of scutes. An olive ridley's four flippers each have one or two claws. The size and shape of the olive ridley vary by region.</p>
