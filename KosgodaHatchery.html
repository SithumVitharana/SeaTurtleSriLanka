        <h2>Kosgoda Sea Turtle Hatchery</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Six of the seven sea turtle species are now endangered. And the majority of it is due to human exploitation of natural resources. Fortunately, this hatchery has taken on the responsibility of protecting them. They begin by keeping an eye on the nesting mother turtles, transporting their eggs to the hatchery, and then releasing the newborn turtles into the sea on the day of their birth. If there are issues, they tend to them and release them only when they are ready to be released into the vast ocean.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Kosgoda is one of the few hatcheries in the country where all five species make their nests. The Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads, and Hawksbills are among them.</p>
        <h3>Information and Location</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="InfonMap-lay01">
            <div class="Info-OH">
                <p class="OH-subc-p">Dudley Perera's project has been underway since 1988.  The project's main goal is to monitor local sea turtle activity and protect local nesting places.  We want to raise public awareness about how endangered these magnificent species are and how critical it is to help protect them before it's too late.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="OH-subc-p">The project's hatchery is one of its most essential initiatives. The project's refuge allows collected and saved eggs to hatch securely away from predators before being released back into the sea. Furthermore, a portion of each hatching is held back for a short period of time for 'headstarting' before release. Only a few hatchlings from each batch survive to adulthood. As a result, every nesting site, every egg, every hatchling, and every turtle is critical to the species' survival. Unfortunately, marine turtles face numerous threats.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="OH-subc-p">The project's work is supported by fundraisers and grants. Every year, the organization clears and maintains the local beach, protects key nesting grounds (especially important after the Tsunami), and releases thousands of hatchlings. When you consider how long the project has been running, you may begin to comprehend its significance!</p>

        <h3>Project Work</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="ProjectWork">
            <h4>Beach Conservation</h4>
            <div class="OH-content">
                <img class="OH-imgs" src="Images/KH-BeachConservation.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="OH-subc-p">Beach conservation, is the conscious management of ecosystems in oceans and seas to minimize over-exploitation of natural marine resources. Marine conservation is informed by the study of marine plants and animal resources, as well as ecosystem functions, and is motivated by a response to the environment's manifested negative consequences, such as species loss, habitat degradation, and changes in ecosystem services. It focuses on reducing human-caused marine ecosystem degradation, rebuilding damaged marine ecosystems, and protecting vulnerable marine species and ecosystems.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Night Patrol</h4>
            <div class="OH-content">
                <img class="OH-imgs" src="Images/KH-NightPatrol02.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="OH-subc-p">Nothing beats a night patrol. Not only will patrolling the beach dissuade poachers, but you may also witness a stunning female turtle approaching to nest. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that should not be passed up. Turtles congregate on beaches at night to lay their eggs, when they are most vulnerable. The nests become vulnerable to predators and poachers once the eggs are laid.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Project Operations</h4>
            <div class="OH-content">
                <img class="OH-imgs" src="Images/KH-ProjectOperations.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="OH-subc-p">The initiative relies on both volunteers and the local community to stay running. The project must be kept clean and tidy, visitors must be guided through the site, the turtle tanks must be kept in good condition, and the turtles must be cared for and fed. However, that is all part of the job.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Hatchery</h4>
            <div class="OH-content">
                <img class="OH-imgs" src="Images/KH-Hatchery.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="OH-subc-p">The eggs are collected from coastal nests and reburied in the hatchery where they can hatch securely. The majority of hatchlings are released as soon as possible at night (hatchlings should never be released during the day), but some are held back for a short period of time for 'headstarting' until they are stronger. </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Community</h4>
            <div class="OH-content">
                <img class="OH-imgs" src="Images/KH-Community.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="OH-subc-p">We hired all turtle egg poachers as turtle nest guardians, and they patrolled the beaches 24 hours a day, seven days a week to protect the turtle nests in-situ. Then we taught these local nest guardians to be tourist guides. In Rekawa village, we also promoted the turtle night watch environmental tourism program. We developed a community-based organization called "Nature Friends of Rekawa (NFR)" that included all of the nest protectors. We transferred some monies to NFR in order to provide hands-on project management training. Furthermore, we formed several collaborations with government agencies, media outlets, and non-governmental organizations to carry out a variety of community-based projects in Rekawa village. To assist the neighborhood members, we provided numerous alternative livelihood projects such as batik, sewing, coir mat, and ornamental fish rearing.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <div class="OH-content">
                <img class="OH-imgs" src="Images/KH-Education02.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="OH-subc-p">You will not only learn a lot about turtles for yourself at the project, but you will also have the opportunity to teach others. Volunteers will be able to join project tours and share their newly learned knowledge with locals and tourists. Education and awareness about these fascinating animals and the problems they face are vital to their conservation.</p>
